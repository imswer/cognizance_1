step 1: START 

step 2: Initialize s to zero
step 3: Initialize t to one
step 4: Initialize m to zero

step 5: DISPLAY Enter a number : 
step 6: n=INPUT
step 7: READ n
 
step 8.0: for (Initialize i to 2,i is less than n,increment i every loop) 
     8.1: SET m = s+t
     8.2: SET s = t
     8.3: SET t = m
step 9: END for

step 10 : print m

step 11 : STOP
